# todolist
A todo list app designed to exemplify some coding practices and third party integrations.  Still
very much a work in progress.

This project plays with some design and architecture ideas I been throwing around, so it doesn't
necessarily represent my typical production level code.

# Configure Google Sign In
in order to use this project, you need to add a google-services.json file to the app directory.
This file will provide the configuration needed for your specific application.
The json file can be generated by Google's website.  See the reference link for more information.

Reference: https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start-integrating

The google-services.json file should be added to your git ignore file.

### ~/.gitignore_global
```
...
app/google-services.json
```


# Configure Parse
In order to use this project, you will need to add a couple string resources used to configure Parse.
I created a resource file that only contains those values.  I then added that file to my git ignore.

### todolist/app/src/main/res/values/parse_config.xml
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="parse_application_id">application id</string>
    <string name="parse_client_key">client_key</string>
</resources>
```
### ~/.gitignore_global
```
...
app/src/main/res/values/parse_config.xml
```
